# TextToEmoji
Replace :text: with appropriate emojis, slack-style. 

## Known Bugs
- Cursor moves to the start each time text is replaced with emoji
- Need to press 'spacebar' for emoji to enter DOM or else :text: appears
- Cannot backspace after emoji is inserted
- Does not support multiple chat windows simultaneosly
- I'm sure there are more...
